### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project aims to leverage Python for exploring and analyzing data from bike share systems in three prominent cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. As a data science student, this project provides an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in data manipulation, computation of descriptive statistics, and interactive data presentation using Python.

### Usage
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the Python script bike_share_analysis.py using the command: python bikeshare.py
3. The script will prompt you to choose a city (Chicago, New York City, or Washington) and present various options to explore different aspects of the bike share data.
4. Interact with the script by providing your preferences, and it will compute the relevant descriptive statistics and display them in the terminal.


### Files used
bikeshare.py, chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv

### Credits
This project was completed as part of the Bertelsmann Next Generation Tech Booster and Udacity Nanodegree Programs. As a student enrolled in these programs, I had the opportunity to enhance my data science skills and apply them to real-world scenarios.

I would like to express my gratitude to the instructors and course staff for their valuable guidance, support, and feedback throughout the project. Their expertise and commitment played a significant role in my learning experience.
