### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project aims to leverage Python for exploring and analyzing data from bike share systems in three prominent cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. As a data science student, this project provides an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in data manipulation, computation of descriptive statistics, and interactive data presentation using Python.

### Files used
bikeshare.py, chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv
README.md: The current file, which provides an overview of the project.

### Credits
This project was completed as part of the Bertelsmann Next Generation Tech Booster and Udacity Nanodegree Programs. As a student enrolled in these programs, I had the opportunity to enhance my data science skills and apply them to real-world scenarios.

I would like to express my gratitude to the instructors and course staff for their valuable guidance, support, and feedback throughout the project. Their expertise and commitment played a significant role in my learning experience.
